Aaron, go lock yourself in the basement!
I decided that I'm gonna lock Aaron in here alone.

Aaron, you go in first.
Aaron, I want you to go into the ladies' room.

As I look down the stairs I see Aaron, but it does not look like Aaron or feel like Aaron. He is unrecognizable.

Aaron starts to leave us, and it makes me angry. # S23E13

# I Am Haunted
At some point Aaron and I started calling each other G and talking in a slur for no reason.
Aaron can go from happy and laughing to Dark Aaron in a second. I call him The Complainer.
How many times will Aaron fart on live TV? How will I edit that out?
A witch doused Aaron in goat's blood during a pagan ritual. He wasn't the same after that ceremony.
