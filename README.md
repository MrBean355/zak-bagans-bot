# Zak Bagans Reddit Bot

This is a Reddit bot for [r/GhostAdventures](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostAdventures/) which replies to messages that
mention Zak with random quotes.

Credits go to [u/shiverstar](https://www.reddit.com/user/shiverstar/) for the idea! It was discussed
in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostAdventures/comments/mguuyi/we_need_a_zakbot/).

## Current State

At the moment, the bot doesn't post replies. I'm working on stabilising it to make sure it doesn't post when it
shouldn't.

## Adding Responses

It's super easy to add new responses to the bot! As long as you're familiar with opening pull requests!

- Have a look at the
  various [response files](https://github.com/MrBean355/zak-bagans-bot/tree/master/src/main/resources/phrases).
- There are comments inside each file that explain them a bit better.
- To add a new response, simply add a new line in the respective file and open a pull request!
